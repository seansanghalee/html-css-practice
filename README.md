# HTML/CSS Practice

## Web design practice projects written in HTML and CSS

This project contains multiple smaller projects that demonstrate how to create beautiful websites using HTML and CSS. Most of them are clones from existing services or Nomad Coder's lectures.

### bookstore

This project clones a library page of a bookstore application.

### music-player

This project clones two pages of a music streaming application. The first page contains information about the artist and the second page replicates a music player.
